<p>In order to use the RDBMS backend you need:</p>

    
<ul>
<li>
        
<p>A database with the Ontopia Topic Maps schema set up.
        SQL scripts to create the tables are in
        <tt>rdbms/setup</tt>.</p>
      
</li>
<li>
        
<p>A JDBC driver for your particular database. In the
        default installation this goes in
        <tt>apache-tomcat/common/lib</tt>.</p>
      
</li>
<li>
        
<p>A property file describing how to connect to the
        database. There are examples in
        <tt>rdbms/config</tt>. Put it in
        <tt>apache-tomcat/common/classes</tt>.</p>
      
</li>
<li>
        
<p>To make Ontopia look for topic maps in the database you
        must also add an RDBMS source to the
        <tt>apache-tomcat/common/classes/tm-sources.xml</tt>
        file. You'll find examples commented out at the bottom of the
        file.</p>

<h2>
<a name="sect-intro">2. Introduction</a>
</h2>
    

    
<p>The RDBMS Backend Connector adds relational database
    persistence support to the Ontopia Topic Maps Engine. The
    persistence is transparent and users of the topic map interfaces
    don't have to take any additional steps in order to persist topic
    maps. Applications that uses the RDBMS Backend Connector must
    properly demarcate transactions and follow the general rules in a
    transactional system. This includes managing the life-cycle of
    topic map stores and transactions.</p>

  

  
<h2>
<a name="N1006C">3. Installation</a>
</h2>
    

    
<p>Before you can install and start using the RDBMS Backend
    Connector you must have an RDBMS server installed, and you must
    have created a database inside it. (The database can have any name
    since Ontopia finds the database name from the JDBC URL.) You also
    need a JDBC 2.0 driver, and to have set everything up so that you
    can connect to the database through the JDBC driver. If you want
    to use batch writing or connection pooling you will also have to
    install the JDBC 2.0 optional package. Once this is done, you are
    ready to start.</p>

    
<h3>
<a name="N10074">3.1. Requirements</a>
</h3>
      
      
      
<p>A JDBC 2.0 driver for your database must be available on
      your CLASSPATH. Your database vendor should be able to provide
      you with an appropriate JDBC driver.</p>

      
<p>If you want to use connection pooling you need the JDBC
      2.0 Optional Package API (the javax.sql packages) on your
      CLASSPATH. This API can be downloaded from <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdbc/download.html">Sun
      Microsystems</a>.</p>
      
    

    
<h3>
<a name="N10084">3.2. Unicode support</a>
</h3>
      

      
<p>Ontopia fully supports Unicode, but
      for the RDBMS Connector to support Unicode the database must
      support storing Unicode text. Most databases do not enable this
      by default, and require special options to be set when creating
      the database. This section documents these options for various
      databases. Note that you need only do this if you actually need
      to store Unicode characters in your database.</p>

      
<p>If you don't do this, the tests in the test suite that
      verify Unicode support will fail. This will give failure reports
      like the ones shown below.
      </p>


<pre>
There were 4 failures:
1) testFile(net.ontopia.topicmaps.xml.test.AbstractCanonicalTests$CanonicalTestCase) "test file unicode.xtm canonicalized wrongly"
2) testFile(net.ontopia.topicmaps.xml.test.AbstractCanonicalTests$CanonicalTestCase) "test file unicode.iso canonicalized wrongly"
3) testExport(net.ontopia.topicmaps.xml.test.AbstractCanonicalExporterTests$CanonicalTestCase) "test file unicode.xtm canonicalized wrongly"
4) testExport(net.ontopia.topicmaps.xml.test.AbstractCanonicalExporterTests$CanonicalTestCase) "test file unicode.iso canonicalized wrongly"

<h3>
<a name="N100C6">3.3. Creating the database schema</a>
</h3>
      

      
<p>The next step is to create the topic map database schema
      in the database. This is done by executing the SQL scripts
      provided in one of the <tt>*.create.sql</tt> files,
      found in the <tt>$ONTOPIA_HOME/rdbms/setup</tt>
      directory. If there is no script for the database you are using,
      use the <tt>generic.create.sql</tt> script.</p>

      
<p>There are also scripts for dropping the database
      schema in the same directory.</p>

      
<p>These scripts create the tables with primary keys and
      indexes in the database. They also initialize the
      <tt class="symbol">TM_ADMIN_SEQUENCE</tt> table by inserting a single
      row. The <tt class="symbol">TM_ADMIN_SEQUENCE</tt> table contains the
      sequence counters used to generate object identities.</p>

      
<p>In later versions we will provide a command-line tool
      which initializes the database for you automatically. In the
      meantime, if you run into problems when initializing the
      database, please send an email to <a href="mailto:support@ontopia.net">support@ontopia.net</a>.
      </p>

      
<p>The next step is to create a properties file that contains
      the information necessary to connect to the database.</p>

      
<h4>
<a name="N100ED">3.3.1. Microsoft SQL Server 2005</a>
</h4>
        

        
<p>Only SQL Server 2005 or newer versions are
supported. Older versions may work, but there will be contention in
the database if used in a concurrent environment.</p>

        
<p>In order to enable the snapshot isolation and row
versioning features (both needed by Ontopia) the following two
statements need to be executed in the database. Replace the
<tt class="symbol">topicmaps</tt> name with the name of your database. Note
that this will not work with the <tt class="symbol">master</tt> database as
the <tt class="symbol">read_committed_snapshot</tt> is not supported in that
database. Use a custom database instead.</p>


<pre>
alter database topicmaps set allow_snapshot_isolation on;
alter database topicmaps set read_committed_snapshot on;
</pre>

        
<p>More information about the database features can be found <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/tcbchxcb(VS.80).aspx">here</a>.</p>

      
      
    

    
<h3>
<a name="N1010D">3.4. Setting up the properties file</a>
</h3>
      

      
<p>Before we can connect to the database we need to tell the
      backend how to connect to the database. This is done by writing
      a Java properties file that provides the necessary
      information. Below are listed the properties that need to be
      defined. You can put the properties file anywhere you like, but
      it is recommended to place it together with other configuration
      files. For Ontopia to find this file you have to point to it
      from the <tt>tm-sources.xml</tt> file. (See the
      Navigator Configuration guide for details, but by default this
      file is located in
      <tt>apache-tomcat/common/classes</tt>.)</p>

      
<p>The default properties file for use in applications can be
      designated by setting the
      <tt class="symbol">net.ontopia.topicmaps.impl.rdbms.PropertyFile</tt>
      system property to the property filename. Note that the default
      can always be overridden through the APIs.</p>

      
<p>A collection of sample database properties files can be
      found in the <tt class="symbol">$ONTOPIA_HOME/rdbms/config</tt>
      directory.</p>
              
    
<h4>
<a name="N10127">3.4.1. Database connection</a>
</h4>
      


<dl>
<dt>net.ontopia.topicmaps.impl.rdbms.Database</dt>
<dd>
<p>Type: token, Required: yes</p>
<p>This property specifies which database it is running
           against. The RDBMS Backend Connector uses this information
           to adjust the SQL it generates, and also to do
           optimizations.</p>
<p>Possible values are: <tt class="symbol">oracle8</tt>,
            <tt class="symbol">oracle9i</tt>, <tt class="symbol">oracle10g</tt>,

            setting.</p>
</dd>
<dt>net.ontopia.topicmaps.impl.rdbms.ConnectionString</dt>
<dd>
<p>Type: string, Required: yes</p>
<p>This is the JDBC connection string, which must be
           specified.  The value will depend on which database you
           are using and how you have configured it.</p>
</dd>
<dt>net.ontopia.topicmaps.impl.rdbms.DriverClass</dt>
<dd>
<p>Type: string (class name), Required: yes</p>
<p>This is the fully qualified class name of the JDBC
           driver class to use. It must be set. Note that this must
           be a JDBC 2.0 driver.</p>
</dd>
<dt>net.ontopia.topicmaps.impl.rdbms.UserName</dt>
<dd>
<p>Type: string, Required: yes</p>
<p>This is the user name of the database user.</p>
</dd>
<dt>net.ontopia.topicmaps.impl.rdbms.Password</dt>
<dd>
<p>Type: string, Required: yes</p>
<p>This is the password of the database user.</p>
</dd>
<dt>net.ontopia.topicmaps.impl.rdbms.BatchUpdates</dt>
<dd>
<p>Type: boolean, Default: false</p>
<p>If set to <tt class="symbol">true</tt> all database modifications
             will be performed through JDBC batch updates.</p>
<p>This option boosts performance with large
            transactions and in environments where network lag is an
            issue, since the number of network requests needed is
            significantly lower and the database may provide
            optimizations for performing lots of similar database
            modifications in batches.</p>
<p>Note that some JDBC drivers do not support batch
            updates. Please verify that your JDBC driver actually
            supports batch updates before enabling it.</p>

<h4>
<a name="N101B1">3.4.2. Clustering</a>
</h4>
      

      
<p>If multiple instances of the RDBMS Backend Connector are
      to access the same topic map(s) the clustering feature
      <em>must</em> be enabled to prevent
      inconsistencies. As each instance holds an internal data cache
      any modifications to the data needs to be replicated across all
      nodes in the cluster. This must be done to prevent any of the
      nodes from holding stale data.
      </p>

      
<dl>
<dt class="warning">Warning</dt>
<dd>
        
<p>Note that if your application uses the Web Editor
        framework then another clustering configuration needs to the
        set up. See the <cite><a href="../webed/devguide.html">Web Editor Framework Developer's
        Guide</a></cite> for more information.</p>
      
</dd>
</dl>
      
      
<dl>
<dt>net.ontopia.topicmaps.impl.rdbms.Cluster.id</dt>
<dd>
<p>Type: string, Default: none</p>
<p>This property specifies the id of the cluster that
            the instance should be a member of. All instances that
            access the same topic map should be members of the same
            cluster. Specifying this property will make the instance
            connect to to the cluster on startup.</p>
<p>The cluster identifier must start with
            <tt class="symbol">jgroups:</tt>,
            e.g. <tt class="symbol">jgroups:cluster:my-topicmaps</tt>. JGroups
            is currently the only clustering implementation for cache
            invalidation.</p>
</dd>
<dt>net.ontopia.topicmaps.impl.rdbms.Cluster.properties</dt>
<dd>
<p>Type: string, Default: none</p>
<p>This property lets one pass in the name of a file
            containing configuration properties used by the clustering
            implementation. If the property is not specified the
            default properties will be used. The file will be first
            attempted loaded from the file system, then from the
            classpath.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

     
<p>Note that there is a critical bug in pre-1.6 JVMs related
     to IPv6 network support that prevents them from being used with
     JGroups out of the box. To make JGroups use IPv4 make sure that
     you pass the following system property to the JVM on
     startup:</p>

<h4>
<a name="N101F8">3.4.3. Caching</a>
</h4>
      

      
<p>The RDBMS Backend Connector retrieves all its data from
      the backing relational database. The communication with the
      database is relatively fast, but can introduce a big performance
      hit when the network traffic is high. In order to offer high
      performance Ontopia provides a number of client-caches that
      makes it possible to avoid repeated reads from the database.
      </p>

      
<dl>
<dt>net.ontopia.topicmaps.impl.rdbms.Cache.shared</dt>
<dd>
<p>Type: boolean, Default: true</p>
<p>Because the RDBMS Backend Connector supports
            concurrent transactions the database communication needs
            to be effective and non-redundant. Ontopia provides a
            cache implementation that transactions can share, so that
            redundant database access is avoided. This cache is
            enabled by default when using the Navigator and Web Editor
            Frameworks. Note that when using the Topic Maps Engine API
            one must access the topic map store through one of the
            topic map source implementations in the RDBMS Backend to
            make use of the shared cache. Warning: If one does not use
            the shared cache in a multi-user environment the
            performance hit can be very high.</p>
<p>The only situation where you should consider
            disabling this cache is when you have one long-running
            transaction. In this case it is best to disable the shared
            cache because it adds an overhead and can, if the
            transaction is big, also cause the transaction to run out
            of memory. Without a shared cache there is no limit on the
            size of transactions.</p>
<dl>
<dt class="warning">Warning</dt>
<dd>
            
<p>Do not disable the shared cache when there
            are concurrent transactions updating the
            same topic map as this would mean that the transactions
            might not see each other's committed changes.</p>
            
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>net.ontopia.topicmaps.impl.rdbms.Cache.identitymap.lru</dt>
<dd>
<p>Type: integer (# items in cache), Default: 300</p>
<p>Each transaction maintains a mapping between the
            object ids of topic map objects and the topic map objects
            themselves. This data structure holds soft references to
            the topic map objects and the objects can therefore be
            garbage collected when there are no other hard references
            to them. This is a mechanism that lets the Java Virtual
            Machine get rid of objects when it needs to reclaim memory
            in order to not run out of memory. This datastructure is
            also extremely useful for the transaction itself because
            it uses it to avoid having to create object instances too
            often.</p>
<p>This property tells Ontopia that it should hold hard
            references to the most recently used objects and for how
            many objects it should do so. Note that the property
            specifies the number of hard references per transaction,
            so when adjusting this number take into account how many
            concurrent transactions you might have and how much memory
            is available.</p>
</dd>
<dt>net.ontopia.topicmaps.impl.rdbms.Cache.shared.identitymap.lru</dt>
<dd>
<p>Type: integer (# items in cache), Default: 5000</p>
<p>This property is similiar to the previous one, but
            this one is used to define the size of the lru of the
            shared identity map. The shared identity map is shared
            amongst all read-only transactions. In general this one
            should be bigger than the previous one as there are
            usually a lot more read-only transactions in the system
            than read-write ones.</p>

</h4>
      

      
<p>The RDBMS Backend Connector uses JDBC connections to
      access the relational database. Being able to reuse connections
      across interactions with the database is important because
      creating connections is expensive. The RDBMS Backend Connector
      supports different JDBC connection pool implementations. Use the
      following properties to enable and configure connection
      pooling:</p>


<dl>

                  pooling will be used. The default connection pool
                  implementation is 'dbcp'. It is recommended that one
                  use connection pooling if one needs to open more
                  than a single topic map transaction.</p>
</dd>

                 pool, but the pool will shrink back to an acceptable
                 size when the activity is lower. If this setting is
                 false, requests will block until a connection is

</dd>
<dt>net.ontopia.topicmaps.impl.rdbms.ConnectionPool.PoolStatements</dt>

<h4>
<a name="N10303">3.4.5. Topic map store pooling</a>
</h4>
      

      
<p>Ontopia supports pooling of topic map stores in the same
      way as you can pool JDBC connections with the provided
      connection pool implementations. The topic map store pooling is
      currently only available via the topic map reference
      implementation in the RDBMS Backend Connector. When using the
      RDBMS Backend Connector with the Navigator and Web Editor
      frameworks the topic map store pooling is always enabled. Note
      that when using the Topic Maps Engine API one must access the
      topic map stores through one of the topic map source
      implementations in the RDBMS Backend to make use store
      pooling. These topic map source implementations always use store
      pooling.</p>

      
<p>The main reason for using topic map store pooling is that
      it greatly improves performance in transactional
      environements. This is possible because topic map objects, topic
      map data, cached information and other state information can be
      reused across transaction boundaries.</p>

      
<p>You can override the store pool defaults by setting the
      following properties:</p>

      
<dl>
<dt>net.ontopia.topicmaps.impl.rdbms.StorePool.MinimumSize</dt>
<dd>
<p>Type: integer (# stores), Default: 0</p>
<p>The minimum number of stores in the pool. The
                 number of stores in the pool will never shrink below
                 this size.</p>
</dd>
<dt>net.ontopia.topicmaps.impl.rdbms.StorePool.MaximumSize</dt>
<dd>
<p>Type: integer (# stores), Default: 8</p>
<p>The maximum number of stores in the pool. The
                 number of stores will never grow larger than this
                 number, unless the soft maximum is enabled.</p>
</dd>
<dt>net.ontopia.topicmaps.impl.rdbms.StorePool.SoftMaximum</dt>
<dd>
<p>Type: boolean, Default: false</p>
<p>If the maximum pool size is reached but there
                 are outstanding requests for stores emergency stores
                 will be created if this property is true. This will
                 temporarily increase the size of the pool, but the
                 pool will shrink back to an acceptable size when the
                 activity is lower. If this setting is false,
                 requests will block until a connection is
                 available.</p>

<h4>
<a name="N10342">3.4.6. Tolog queries</a>

<p>The RDBMS Backend Connector has its own tolog

      to translate the tolog query into SQL. In most of the cases the
      entire tolog query can be translated fully into a SQL query, but
      for some more complex tolog queries only parts or none of it can
      be translated. Sometimes it makes sense for a topic map
      application to not use the RDBMS tolog implementation. These
      applications can change the default tolog implementation by
      setting the following property:</p>

<h3>
<a name="N103A0">3.5. Native RDBMS full-text</a>
</h3>
      

      
<p>Instead of using the Lucene integration with the RDBMS
      Backend Connector one can take advantage of the native full-text
      support that the database may have. This support can range from
      simple LIKE operator queries to advanced full-text indexing
      support.</p>

      
<p>In the
      <tt class="symbol">net.ontopia.infoset.fulltext.impl.rdbms</tt> package
      there is a class called <tt class="symbol">RDBMSSearcher</tt> that
      implements the <tt class="symbol">SearcherIF</tt> interface. Pass your
      RDBMS <tt class="symbol">TopicMapIF</tt> instance to the single
      constructor of this class and you have a searcher instance that
      let you search for topic name, variant name, and occurrences using
      the native pattern language.</p>

      
<p>The actual queries that are issued and the syntax that are
      supported is usually database specific, but the default
      behaviour is to use the LIKE operator. This means that you can
      use the '%' symbol to specify wildcards in your queries. Most
      relational databases support the LIKE operator, and therefore
      the default should be ok for most databases. Note that the
      actual query will make use of the <tt class="symbol">lower</tt> function
      to make it a case-insensitive query.</p>

      
<p>In addition to the generic RDBMS full-text support Ontopia
      comes with support for several database-specific full-text
      implementations. They are all described below.</p>

      
<p>Note that enabling native RDBMS full-text through the <tt class="symbol">net.ontopia.infoset.fulltext.impl.rdbms.RDBMSSearcher.type</tt> database property will also enable it for the
<tt class="symbol">value-like</tt> tolog predicate.</p>

    
<h4>
<a name="N103C9">3.5.1. Oracle Text</a>
</h4>
      

      
<p>Recent versions of Oracle comes with full-text
support included. The component is called Oracle Text. In older versions Oracle
Text was an optional component and had to be purchased and installed
separately.</p>

      
<p>To enable use of  Oracle Text in Ontopia you will have to set the
      <tt class="symbol">net.ontopia.infoset.fulltext.impl.rdbms.RDBMSSearcher.type</tt>
      database property to
      <tt class="symbol">oracle_text</tt>. You will also have to make sure that the
      columns <tt class="symbol">TM_TOPIC_NAME.content</tt>,
      <tt class="symbol">TM_VARIANT_NAME.content</tt>, and
      <tt class="symbol">TM_OCCURRENCE.content</tt> are setup to be indexed
      by Oracle Text.</p>

      
<p>Here are some sample statements to set this up for
      Oracle. Note that they require the Oracle Context Option, which
      for Oracle 8.x needs to be installed separately, but for Oracle
      9i and later it should be installed by default.</p>

    
<code>
<pre>
create index TEXT_TOPIC_NAME on TM_TOPIC_NAME(content) 
  indextype is ctxsys.context 
  parameters ('sync(on commit) datastore ctxsys.default_datastore filter ctxsys.null_filter section group ctxsys.auto_section_group');
create index TEXT_OCCURRENCE on TM_OCCURRENCE(content) 
  indextype is ctxsys.context 
  parameters ('sync(on commit) datastore ctxsys.default_datastore filter ctxsys.null_filter section group ctxsys.auto_section_group');
create index TEXT_VARIANT_NAME on TM_VARIANT_NAME(content) 
  indextype is ctxsys.context 
  parameters ('sync(on commit) datastore ctxsys.default_datastore filter ctxsys.null_filter section group ctxsys.auto_section_group');
</pre>
</code>

    
<p>These indexes will be kept up to date on every commit. If
    you don't need to have them synced that often, consider changing
    the sync parameter.</p>



      
<p>An error message will be issued by the Oracle RDBMS if one
      attempts to use the Oracle Text query when the columns have not been
      full-text indexed, so if this happens you will have to run the
      create index statements above or similar ones.</p>

      
<p>Please consult your database documentation for more
      information on Oracle Text.</p>

      

    

    
<h4>
<a name="N103F7">3.5.2. PostgreSQL full-text</a>
</h4>
      

      
<p>The full-text support in PostgreSQL is implemented through
a module called <a href="http://www.sai.msu.su/~megera/postgres/gist/tsearch/V2/">tsearch2</a>. This
module will usually have to be installed manually before it can be
used. This is typically done by logging in as the PostgreSQL
administrator user and running the
<tt>${PSQL_LIB}/contrib/tsearch2.sql</tt> script in the
database, e.g. using the <tt class="symbol">psql</tt> command line
utility. If you later which to uninstall tsearch2 that can be done
with the <tt>${PSQL_LIB}/contrib/untsearch2.sql</tt>
script.</p>

    
<p>The next step is to grant access to the tsearch2 tables to
the database user that is used by Ontopia. Replace
<tt class="symbol">myuser</tt> with the name of your database user below.</p>

      
<code>
<pre>
grant all on pg_ts_cfg to myuser;
grant all on pg_ts_cfgmap to myuser;
grant all on pg_ts_dict to myuser;
grant all on pg_ts_parser to myuser;
</pre>
</code>
  
      
<p>tsearch2 will then have to be told which of its configurations that are to be used. Ontopia uses a configuration called <tt class="symbol">default</tt>. The configurations are mapped to the server encoding. Issue the following statement to set the locale for the default configration.</p>

      
<code>
<pre>
update pg_ts_cfg set locale='en_US.UTF-8' where ts_name='default';
</pre>
</code>

      
<p>If you don't know what the server encoding is then the following query will tell you:</p>
      
<code>
<pre>
select setting from pg_settings where name='lc_ctype';
</pre>
</code>

      
<p>The last step is to add a tsearch2 column and an index to
each of the three tables that are to be searched. To keep the index
up-to-date a set of triggers will also have to be added.</p>

      
<code>
<pre>
/* add columns */
alter table TM_TOPIC_NAME add column tsearch2 tsvector;
alter table TM_VARIANT_NAME add column tsearch2 tsvector;
alter table TM_OCCURRENCE add column tsearch2 tsvector;
/* create indexes */
create index tsearch2_index_tbn on TM_TOPIC_NAME using gist(tsearch2);
create index tsearch2_index_tvn on TM_VARIANT_NAME using gist(tsearch2);
create index tsearch2_index_to on TM_OCCURRENCE using gist(tsearch2);
/* populate indexed columns */
update TM_TOPIC_NAME set tsearch2=to_tsvector('default', coalesce(content,''));
update TM_VARIANT_NAME set tsearch2=to_tsvector('default', coalesce(content, ''));
update TM_OCCURRENCE set tsearch2=to_tsvector('default', coalesce(content, ''));
/* add triggers */
create trigger tsearch2_update_tbn before update or insert on TM_TOPIC_NAME for each row execute procedure tsearch2(tsearch2, content);
create trigger tsearch2_update_tvn before update or insert on TM_VARIANT_NAME for each row execute procedure tsearch2(tsearch2, content);
create trigger tsearch2_update_to before update or insert on TM_OCCURRENCE for each row execute procedure tsearch2(tsearch2, content);
</pre>
</code>

      
<p>To enable use of tsearch2 in Ontopia you will have to
set the
<tt class="symbol">net.ontopia.infoset.fulltext.impl.rdbms.RDBMSSearcher.type</tt>
database property to <tt class="symbol">postgresql</tt> or <tt class="symbol">tsearch2</tt>.</p>

<code>
<pre>
EXEC sp_fulltext_database 'enable';
</pre>
</code>

      
<p>Then a full-text catalog has to be created and one
full-text index added to each of the three tables that are be
indexed. The database server will keep the full-text indexes
automatically up to date as changes occur.</p>

      
<code>
<pre>

create fulltext index on TM_TOPIC_NAME(content) key index TM_TOPIC_NAME_pkey;
create fulltext index on TM_VARIANT_NAME(content) key index TM_VARIANT_NAME_pkey;
create fulltext index on TM_OCCURRENCE(content) key index TM_OCCURRENCE_pkey;
alter fulltext catalog okscatalog reorganize;

<p>Note that the <tt class="symbol">TM_TOPIC_NAME_pkey</tt>,
<tt class="symbol">TM_VARIANT_NAME_pkey</tt> and

      environment correctly set up. This includes having the ontopia.jar and ontopia-test.jar-files on the CLASSPATH. See
      the <cite>Ontopia, Installation and getting
      started</cite> document for more information.</p>
                     
      
<p>You can now run the test suite by following the procedure
      below:</p>

      
<dl>
<dt>Windows</dt>
<dd>Go to the <tt>${basedir}</tt>
        directory. Set the environment variable
        <tt>ONTOPIA_HOME</tt> to the <tt class="symbol">${basedir}</tt>,
        using the command
        <tt>set ONTOPIA_HOME=${basedir}</tt>. Then run the
        <tt>tests\runtests-rdbms.bat</tt> script passing the
        property file as an argument.</dd>
<dt>Unix</dt>
<dd>Go to the <tt>${basedir}</tt>
        directory. Then run the
        <tt>tests/runtests-rdbms.sh</tt> script passing the
        property file as an argument.</dd>
</dl>
      
      
<p>The result should be similiar to what is shown below. If
      it is not, please send an email to <a href="mailto:support@ontopia.net">support@ontopia.net</a>
      with the output of the test run as well as details about your
      platform and the database you are using.</p>
